## ProtoTight

ProtoTight is a tool for prototyping. I wanted a simple unopinionated page routing tool with enough tools that a person with a moderate knowledge of html and css could use it. There is an entire frontend css framework under the hood of this project that is quite robust, but no node or anything like that is required.
