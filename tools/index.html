				<p>This site is to hopefully introduce and perhaps guide you through the QJS development library. It's got... like a lot of tools involved in it. Some of them are for websites, some of them are for games, some are for apps. It's a one stop shop for all the mad ravings of one Hamilton Cline.</p>

			<h2>Not another framework!</h2>
			<p>Agreed! But also, fuck you! I wanted to learn something, and in the process of learning something I made something. And as I added to it it grew, and my understanding grew, and my process changed, and now there is this crazy hodgepodge of code that I will slowly mold into something great. Or perhaps a few mediocre somethings.</p>
