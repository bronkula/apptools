				<h2>Welcome, weary traveler!</h2>
				<p>This site is to hopefully introduce and perhaps guide you through the QJS development library. It's got... like a lot of tools involved in it. Some of them are for websites, some of them are for games, some are for apps. It's a one stop shop for all the mad ravings of one Hamilton Cline.</p>

			<p>Agreed! But also, fuck you! I wanted to learn something, and in the process of learning something I made something. And as I added to it it grew, and my understanding grew, and my process changed, and now there is this crazy hodgepodge of code that I will slowly mold into something great. Or perhaps a few mediocre somethings.</p>

			<p>So what is QJS, and what can it do for you? QJS started as a smaller more focused version of jQuery. It was not ever meant to replace it wholly, but it started as a learning experiment, and then certain issues came up where it became obvious that with a few small additions it could be a powerful tool for web and app development.</p>
			<p>QJS has tools for websites, for apps, and for games. But it's most prominent usecase is for website like applications. It has the basics of a DOM querying library; DOM selectors, fragment creators, and event handlers. It also comes with a routing extension which can allow single document multi page application development. It also has a few tools specifically built around basic promise and fetch handling. It also has some basic type management tools.</p>
			<p>The QJS library is specifically made to be extensible, so adding new functionality to it is decently robust, and allows the community to improve on the original work.</p>
			<p>Along with QJS, you also can have access to more App Tools, such as a color management library, a library of math functions for games, and a suite of canvas manipulation tools.</p>
